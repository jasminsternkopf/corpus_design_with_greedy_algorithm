# corpus_design_with_greedy_algorithm

This repository is based on the paper [Corpus design based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence for Text-To-Speech
synthesis application](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221486254_Corpus_design_based_on_the_kullback-leibler_divergence_for_text-to-speech_synthesis_application) and can be used to build a corpus whose unit distribution is approximately the same as a given target distribution. This is achived by using a greedy algorithm with the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
